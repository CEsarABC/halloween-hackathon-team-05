# Code Institute, Hackathon
## Halloween Hackathon: October 24th, 2018
### 13:00 - 17:00 UTC / 14:00 - 18:00 CET / 8:00 - 12:00 EST

Congratulations on signing up for the Halloween Hackathon! There are only a few days
left until the big day. You should have received an invite to the private
#hackathon-oct2018 Slack channel. If something has changed and you can no longer
participate in the Hackathon, please send a message to haley_ci on Slack within 48
hours of the Hackathon start time.
The goal of this Hackathon is to work together as a team in the same way you would
work on projects in a production environment with your future coworkers.
Working in Mini-Sprints
We encourage you and your teammates to work in mini-sprints for the Hackathon. Just
like you would have 1 or 2 week long sprints when working on large projects in a
company, we recommend that you use half-hour mini-sprints to coordinate your work
on this hackathon. This idea breaks down a large task into smaller, more manageable
tasks. Using mini-sprints can help you and your team budget your time effectively and
communicate with each other on where you are at each stage in the task. Your team
will agree on what the goal(s) is for the end of each mini-sprint. The Pomodoro timer is
a great tool to help you manage your time during these mini-sprints, using 25 minute
work sessions with 5 minute breaks to reconvene with your team to decide on the next
tasks.
Prior to the Hackathon
Please register a Trello account and create a hackathon board for all your team
members to collaborate on. Your team will send a few screenshots of your team’s
Trello board to factor into your Team Collaboration score. Trello is a useful tool for
working in mini-sprints, where your team can keep track of what needs to be done,
what is currently a work in progress, and what has been completed.
Please also register for a free Zoom account. This is similar to Skype, and it will allow
you and your team to participate in the Hackathon Presentations to the other teams
and the judges.
Please also make sure that you are using Cloud 9 and have an active GitHub account.
We would encourage you to work in mini-sprints, and use Trello to promote teamwork
Code Institute, Hackathon
and transparent project management. It may also be helpful to download the Slack
desktop app if you don’t already have it. With the Slack desktop app, you can share
your screen with your teammates during an audio or video call.
At the beginning of the Hackathon, please send a private message to haley_ci on Slack
that includes your team name, a link to your team’s cloud 9 workspace, a link to the
project’s GitHub repository, and a link to your team’s Trello board.

Hackathon Scoring
During the presentations, each judge will score each team in all categories. The

from your Trello board and your project’s GitHub commit history.

Hackathon. Winners will be contacted for a postal address.
